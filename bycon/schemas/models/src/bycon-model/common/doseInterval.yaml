  was constant. For example, to represent a period of 30 mg twice a day for an interval
  of 10 days, we would use a Quantity element to represent the individual 30 mg dose,
  and OntologyClass element to represent twice a day, and an Interval element to represent
  the 10-day interval. Provenance: Phenopackets v2'
