description: Used to describe a phenotype that characterizes the subject or biosample.
type: object

  featureType:
    description: >-
      Term denoting the phenotypic feature. Preferably a value from Human
      Phenotype Ontology (HPO).

    examples:
      - id: HP:0000002
        label: Abnormality of body height
      - id: HP:0002006
        label: Facial cleft

    description: >-
      Flag to indicate whether the disease was observed or not. Default is `false`,
      in other words the disease was observed. Therefore it is only required in
      cases to indicate that the disease was looked for, but found to be absent.
      More formally, this modifier indicates the logical negation of the OntologyClass
      used in the `featureType` field.
      CAUTION: It is imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the disease!

      For instance one or more terms from HPO Clinical Modifier (HP:0012823).
      This subontology is designed to provide terms to characterize and specify the
      phenotypic abnormalities defined in the Phenotypic abnormality subontology,
      with respect to severity, laterality, age of onset, and other aspects.
