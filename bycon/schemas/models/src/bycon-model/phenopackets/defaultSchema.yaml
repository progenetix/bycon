title: Phenopacket
description: >-
  The Phenopacket class is a bare-bones JSON-schema rewrite of the Phenopackets v2
  standard ("PXF"), for the representation of attributes supported in the `bycon` framework.
  At this time the Phenopackets schema is not part of the Beacon v2 default data
  model. However, many sub-schemas in Beacon v2 have been informed by the PXF
  model and development process, allowing a straightforward cross-mapping of the
  data structures.
