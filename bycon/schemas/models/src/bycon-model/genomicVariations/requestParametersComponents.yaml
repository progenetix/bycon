  Assembly:
    description: Genomic assembly accession and version as RefSqeq assembly accession
      (e.g. "GCF_000001405.39") or a versioned assembly name or synonym such as UCSC
      Genome Browser assembly (e.g. "hg38") or Genome Reference Consortium Human (e.g.
      "GRCh38.p13") names.
    type: string
    example:
      - GCF_000001405.39
      - hg38
      - GRCh38.p13
  RefSeqId:
    description: >-
      Reference sequence id for genomic reference sequence in which variant
      coordinates are given, e.g. "NC_000009" for human chromosome 9. Preferably the
      RefSeqId, alternatively, names, synonymous or aliases e.g. "Chr9" could be used.
    type: string
    example:
      - NC_000009
      - Chr9
      - NC_012920.1
      - refseq:NC_000017.11
  ReferenceBases:
    description: >-
      Reference bases for this variant (starting from `start`).
      * Accepted values: [ACGTN]
      * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base,
        and can be used as a standalone base of any type or within a partially known
        sequence. As example, a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of [ACGT]
        and will match `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.
      * an *empty value* is used in the case of insertions with the maximally trimmed,
        inserted sequence being indicated in `AlternateBases`
    type: string
    pattern: ^([ACGTUNRYSWKMBDHV\-\.]*)$
  AlternateBases:
    description: >-
      Alternate bases for this variant (starting from `start`).
      * Accepted values: [ACGTN]
      * N is a wildcard, that denotes the position of any base and can be used as
        a standalone base of any type or within a partially known sequence. As example,
        a query of `ANNT` the Ns can take take any form of [ACGT] and will match
        `ANNT`, `ACNT`, `ACCT`, `ACGT` ... and so forth.
      * an _empty value_ is used in the case of deletions with the maximally
        trimmed, deleted sequence being indicated in `ReferenceBases`
      * Categorical variant queries, _i.e._ such *not* being represented through
        sequence & position, make use of the `variantType` parameter.
      * Either `alternateBases` or `variantType` is required.
