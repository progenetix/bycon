title: GeoLocation

type: object

description: >
  A GeoLocation object represents a geographic location formatted as a
  *GeoJSON feature*. The format is compatible with RFC 7946, while currently
  limiting its scope to features of type "Point".
  Also, the schema defines some optional parameters compatible with the `GeoJSON
  Feature` `properties` wrapper object.
  Examples could be:  
  * an address, e.g. of a lab performing an analysis
  * provenance of an individual, obfuscated to a larger order administrative
    entity (Suffolk, U.K.)
  * a lat/long/alt position where an environmental sample was collected

    description: >
      The geographic point object uses the default units from the
      [DCMI point scheme](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-point/) and
      avoids optional representation in non-standard units. It consists of an
      array with at least 2 ordered numbers for
      - longitude/easting
      - latitude/nothing.
    properties:
      type:
        const: Point
      coordinates:
        description: >
          An array of 2 (longitude, latitude) or 3 (longitude, latitude, altitude) values.
        type: array
        items:
          type: number
          format: float
        minItems: 2
        maxItems: 3
        examples:
          - - 8.55
            - 47.37 
          - - 86.925026
            - 27.987850
            - 8848.86
    required:
      - type
      - coordinates

  GeoLabels:
    description: >-
      GeoLabels represent an instance of the GeoJSON `properties` object. The
      parameters provide additional information for the interpretation of the
      location parameters.
    properties:
      label:
        type: string
        examples:
          - Heidelberg, Germany
          - Gainesville, FL, United States of America
          - Zurich, Switzerland
          - Str Marasesti 5, 300077 Timisoara, Romania
      city:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The optional name of the city the point location maps to. While this
          is a commonly used the point location, it should be considered
          secondary to the `geometry` values in interpreting the geographic location.
      country:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The optional name of the country the location maps to, for sanity
          checks and procedural convenience (see notes for "city").
        examples:
          - Switzerland
      ISO3166alpha3:
        type: string
        examples:
          - USA
          - CHE
      precision:
        type: string
        description: >
          Used together with coordinate annotation, precision represents an
          optional label describing the precision that can be inferred from the
          coordinates. For a precision level of "city", coordinates would have
          to be interpreted as representing any possible location within the
          city's administrative boundaries, not necessarily at the exact
          position of the point coordinates.
          The `precision` parameter can be used to indicate an obfuscation of
          the coordinates, e.g. for privacy protection.
