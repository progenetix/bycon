  AggregationResultsInstance:
    description: >-
      Summary data from results, with distributions of values (or value combinations)
      for one (or more) concepts.
      Each summary is identified by an `id`, `label`, `description`, and a list
      of one or more `concepts`. An an optional `sorted` property can indicate
      to the client that the returned `distribution` of the aggregation objects
      response has some pre-defined order.
      Each of the `concepts` describes the scope (entity; `individual`, `biosample`
      ...), the property aggregated on, and optional `terms` or `splits` for
      selection or binning of the property values.
