description: >-
  Definition for a response that provides solely summaries of records in
  the beacon but not delivers individual records. While summaries might be also part
  of other response types (e.g. result set specific in `beaconResultsetResponse`)
  this response type specifically focuses on providing aggregated statistics of
  a beacon resource similarily to the `beaconBooleanResponse` and `beaconCountResponse`.
