terminal_intervals_soft_expansion_fraction:
  description: >-
    This parameter is used for the generation of chromosome-dependend bins. The
    current method creates equally sized bins (e.g. 1Mb) from centromere -> telomere,
    both for p & q arms. This usually results in the last (p, q) interval being
    <1MB. For some chromosomes this interval may be _very_ small; if the last
    interval is smaller than this value the previous interval will be expanded 
    (e.g. 1050000) and becomes last.
  value: 0.1

interval_min_fraction:
  description: >-
    This value can be used to exclude intervals with a very low CNV overlap (e.g.
    when denoising or to limit edge counts). It is e.g. used for frequency
    calculations; a default of 0.001 results in <1kb not being counted for 1Mb
    bins.
  value: 0.001
