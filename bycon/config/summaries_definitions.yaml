  Definitions of aggregations for the Bycon aggregator service.
  Each aggregation definition contains an `id`, `label`, `description`, and a
  list of one or more `concepts`, as well as an optional `sorted` property which
  can indicate to the client that the returned `distribution` of the aggregation
  result objects response has some pre-sorted order.
  Each of the `concepts` defines the scope (individual, biosample, analysis),
  property to aggregate on, and optional `termIds` or `splits` for selection
  or binning of the results in the returned `distribution`.
