/**
 * returns a BlockSet of which the `blocks` attribute is an array of 'dynamic
 * blocks', which are blocks representing only the regions that are visible in
 * the view right now. these are mostly used by tracks for which static blocks
 * are not feasible.
 *
 * each block is a plain JS object like:
 *   `{ refName, start, end, offsetPx, reversed? }`
 *
 * start and end are in bp, and start is always less than end, but if reversed
 * is true, startBp will be on the right side of the visible region.
 *
 * offsetPx is the number of pixels from the left edge of the view to the left
 * edge of the region
 *
 * NOTE: start, end, and offsetPx may all be fractional!
 *
 * @returns BlockSet of `{ refName, startBp, end, offset, reversed? }`
