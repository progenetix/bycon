          The cancer samples in Progenetix are mapped to several classification
          systems. For each of the classes, aggregated date is available by
          clicking the code. Additionally, a selection of the corresponding
          samples can be initiated by clicking the sample number or selecting
          one or more classes through the checkboxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sample selection follows a hierarchical system in which samples
          matching the child terms of a selected class are included in the
          response.
