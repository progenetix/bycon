# Beacon "Handovers"


Beacon `handover` objects represent an efficient and - used properly -
privacy protecting mechanism to enable data delivery, in conjunction with
Beacon queries.

The advantages of using the "handover" mechanism lie especially in:

* the separation of the standard Beacon variant query and response with the
  privacy-protecting boolean or count response from record level details
* the possibility to link non-Beacon data delivery protocols for "documents"
  (e.g. database records, files)

Handled in a controled/protected environment one could in principle use
the `handover` protocol to access the electronic health records (EHR) of
patients matching a Beacon request.

While the `handover` mechanisms is powerful through its flexibility, an
obvious disadvantage lies in the lack of control about the implemented mechanisms.
